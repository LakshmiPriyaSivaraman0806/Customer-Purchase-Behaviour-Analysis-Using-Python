# Customer-Purchase-Behaviour-Analysis-Using-Python
This Customer Purchase Behaviour Analysis project offers a comprehensive exploration of retail transaction data to uncover insights into customer buying patterns. 
Customer Purchase Behaviour Analysis focuses on understanding how customers interact with products, from which location, including what they buy, when they buy and how discounts influence purchase. By leveraging techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering and visualization, this project aims to reveal meaningful patterns in transactional data. These insights help businesses enhance customer engagement, tailor marketing strategies, inventory management and drive data-informed decision-making.

- **Objective:** The project aims to identify key trends in customer purchasing behavior through transactional data analysis, enabling data-driven decision-making. It supports strategic business planning by uncovering customer needs, identifying target customer segments, optimizing marketing efforts, and enhancing overall sales performance. The analysis also focuses on improving customer satisfaction and encouraging repeat purchases.

## Key Columns in the Dataset:
- **CID, TID :** Customer ID and Transaction ID
- **Gender, Age Group, Location	Customer :** demographics
- **Purchase Date :**	Purchase timestamp
- **Product Category:**	Type of product purchased
- **Discount Availed, Discount Name, Discount Amount (INR):** Discount details
- **Gross Amount, Net Amoun:**	Prices before and after discount
- **Purchase Method:** 	Mode of payment

## Analysis Questions:
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 What is the distribution of customers by Gender, Age Group, and Location?
- 🛍️ Which product categories are most purchased overall and by gender/age?
- 💰 How much revenue is generated by category, location, and discount status?
- 🕒 What is the monthly/seasonal trend in purchase behavior?
- Which discounts are most effective in boosting sales?

## 📌 Recommendations

- **Strengthen inventory and marketing strategies** in top-performing cities such as **Mumbai, Bangalore, and Delhi**, as these regions significantly contribute to overall revenue.

- **Boost engagement in low-performing regions like Srinagar, Varanasi, and Dehradun** by launching targeted promotions, localized marketing efforts, enhancing delivery services, and tailoring product offerings based on regional preferences.

- **Avoid blanket discounts across all products**, as analysis indicates a weak correlation between discounts and increased net revenue. Instead, **adopt personalized discounting strategies** driven by user behavior, purchase history, and product performance.

- **Promote preferred payment methods like PhonePe and credit cards**, which show high conversion rates. Collaborate with these payment providers to offer cashbacks, EMI options, and exclusive rewards during peak sales periods.

- **Address the unique needs of under-18 and senior customers (60+ years)** who tend to favor **Cash on Delivery and Net Banking** due to trust or tech usability concerns. Improve trust signals, simplify the checkout process, and provide educational support to enhance their shopping experience.

- **Capitalize on high-performing product categories** such as **electronics, beauty, and fashion** by introducing bundle offers, cross-category promotions (e.g., mobile + accessories or skincare kits), and prominently showcasing bestsellers on the homepage.

- **Reduce return and refund rates** by improving product listings focus on clearer descriptions, accurate size guides, and high-quality visuals. Implement a feedback mechanism to track return reasons and refine product recommendations accordingly.

- **Introduce loyalty or reward programs** targeting high-value age groups **(20–40 years)**, who account for a major share of transactions and revenue. Incentivize them with birthday discounts, early sale access, and a point-based reward system.

- **Segment marketing campaigns by age group and discount sensitivity**, as younger customers are more responsive to discounts and mobile-optimized content, while older customers prioritize reliability and service quality.

- **Leverage consistent transaction volumes (850–950 per month)** to fine-tune forecasting models for inventory, staffing, and logistics. This ensures efficient resource planning and cost control during peak periods.

## Conclusion:
This project presents a thorough analysis of a retail transaction dataset using data exploration, statistical summaries, and visual storytelling to uncover actionable insights. Key patterns—such as the revenue dominance of metro cities (Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi), limited effectiveness of blanket discounts, and strong buying behavior among the 25–45 age group highlight clear business opportunities. Through segmentation by age, location, product category, and payment preference, the analysis offers a deep understanding of customer behavior.

The resulting strategic recommendations—personalized offers, localized campaigns, loyalty programs, and enhanced product listings—empower businesses to refine marketing, improve inventory planning, and boost customer satisfaction. Overall, this project demonstrates how data-driven decision-making can drive profitability, strengthen customer engagement, and support long-term, scalable business growth.
