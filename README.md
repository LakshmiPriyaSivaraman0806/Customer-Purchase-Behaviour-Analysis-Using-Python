# Customer-Purchase-Behaviour-Analysis-Using-Python
This Customer Purchase Behaviour Analysis project offers a comprehensive exploration of retail transaction data to uncover insights into customer buying patterns. 
Customer Purchase Behaviour Analysis focuses on understanding how customers interact with products, from which location, including what they buy, when they buy and how discounts influence purchase. By leveraging techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering and visualization, this project aims to reveal meaningful patterns in transactional data. These insights help businesses enhance customer engagement, tailor marketing strategies, inventory management and drive data-informed decision-making.

- **Objective:** The project aims to identify key trends in customer purchasing behavior through transactional data analysis, enabling data-driven decision-making. It supports strategic business planning by uncovering customer needs, identifying target customer segments, optimizing marketing efforts, and enhancing overall sales performance. The analysis also focuses on improving customer satisfaction and encouraging repeat purchases.

## Key Columns in the Dataset:
- **CID, TID :** Customer ID and Transaction ID
- **Gender, Age Group, Location	Customer :** demographics
- **Purchase Date :**	Purchase timestamp
- **Product Category:**	Type of product purchased
- **Discount Availed, Discount Name, Discount Amount (INR):** Discount details
- **Gross Amount, Net Amoun:**	Prices before and after discount
- **Purchase Method:** 	Mode of payment

## Analysis Questions:
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 What is the distribution of customers by Gender, Age Group, and Location?
- 🛍️ Which product categories are most purchased overall and by gender/age?
- 💰 How much revenue is generated by category, location, and discount status?
- 🕒 What is the monthly/seasonal trend in purchase behavior?

## Recommendation:
- Strengthen inventory and marketing strategies in top-performing cities like Mumbai, Bangalore, and Delhi, as they contribute significantly to the company’s revenue.
- Avoid offering universal or blanket discounts across all products, as the analysis revealed that discounts do not strongly correlate with increased net revenue. Instead, implement personalized discounting strategies based on user behavior, purchase history, and product performance.
- Promote high-converting payment options such as PhonePe and credit cards, as they are the most preferred among customers. Collaborate with these payment providers to offer cashbacks, rewards, or EMI options during high-traffic sales periods to increase conversion rates.
- Address the needs of under-18 and senior customer segments (above 60 years) who prefer Cash on Delivery or Net Banking due to trust and tech usability concerns. Improve trust signals, simplify the checkout process, and offer educational content or customer support to guide these users.
- Leverage the popularity of electronics, beauty, and fashion categories, which show strong purchase and revenue patterns. Introduce bundle offers, cross-category promotions (e.g., mobile + accessories or skincare combo packs), and highlight bestsellers on the homepage to drive more sales.
- Reduce refund rates by improving product descriptions, visuals, and size guides, especially in high-return categories. Implement a feedback loop where customer return reasons are logged and used to refine product listings and recommendations.
- Design loyalty or reward programs targeting high-value age groups (20–40 years) who contribute the most to transaction volume and revenue. Offer birthday discounts, point-based systems, and early access to sales to retain these customers.
- Segment marketing campaigns by age group and discount behavior, as age impacts both product preferences and payment choices. Younger users are more likely to respond to discounts and mobile-friendly campaigns, while older users may prefer reliability and service quality.
- Use the stable transaction volume (850–950 transactions/month) to improve forecasting models for stock, staffing, and logistics planning. This can help reduce operational costs and ensure smoother peak-season operations.
- Introduce seasonal and location-specific campaigns that consider customer geography and shopping patterns. For example, promote festive wear and electronics in metro cities during Diwali or summer essentials during April–May, based on seasonal buying trends.
